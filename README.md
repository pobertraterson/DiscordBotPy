# DiscordBotPy
An example discord bot.

I made a discord bot called The Pob Bot, named similarly to my main username everywhere.

I originally made the bot open-source, and although I'd still like it do, I made the bot to have a joke around with friends.
So people who would download the bot files would just look at the injokes and go "what is that"?

Basically, it's a bot for injokes and spotify recommendations...

But the example files are still open. Download and do whatever you like!
